    text: 'While feeding the seagulls in Red Square while you have your lunch may be entertaining, according to the Department of Conservation and Recreation from Massachusetts, feeding wildlife like seagulls a diet of french fries or bread doesn’t have the same nutritional value of natural foods, which may impact the long-term survival of the birds. a study from Duke University found that at least 1.4 million seagulls feed at landfills throughout North America, and produce an extra 240 tons of nitrogen and 39 tons of phosphorus into nearby reservoirs and lakes.\nSo when a seagull might look extra hungry to you, do what small part you can and eat the fry by yourself! Make sure to also take any leftovers with you, and there are trash cans located across campus for you to use',

    text: 'The UW Farm is a local student-powered certified organic farm located right on campus! They use organic farming practices as one way to achieve productive and sustainable urban landscapes. According to research done by Washington State University professor John P. Reganold, organic agriculture tends to be more energy efficient, have better soil quality, less soil erosion, and greater biodiversity from less pollution from insecticides. With climate change as an ongoing issue, it’s important to support local and organic farms within your means!',

    text: 'Conibear Shellhouse is the second largest natural lake in Washington and it sits right next to the waters of Lake Washington. Plastic waste is not a new problem, with 60% of all plastic produced discarded in landfills or in the natural environment (source). When the plastic breaks down (as they don’t biodegrade), they form microplastics. Puget Soundkeeper is an organization that has recently started monitoring microplastic pollution in our waterways, and found that between 2019 to 2020 all 69 samples collected across the Puget Sound region contained microplastics. \nAs the impact of microplastics on human and environmental health continues to be studied, do your part by reducing your consumption of single-use plastics and dispose of your waste properly!',

    phrase: 'Paint that taints',
    text: 'The Henry Art Gallery is Washington’s first art museum, founded in 1926. It aims to display work from emerging artists that pushes the boundaries of contemporary art and culture, meaning the art displayed uses a variety of different mediums. Paint is likely the first medium you would think of when the word “art” is mentioned, but what are the environmental impacts of various types of paint? According to a recent study published a few months ago by the University of Oldenburg, ship coatings where plastics are used as binder in acrylic paints or epoxy resins introduce microplastics into the water. At the individual level, it’s still important to safely use and dispose of your paints (be it latex to acrylic paints) for human health, wildlife, fish, and groundwater. King County recommends drying out water-based paints and dispose of the dry paint in trash. \nMake sure to check your local government’s guidelines for disposing hazardous waste like paint, and if they have any recycling programs for paint!',
