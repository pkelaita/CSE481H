      1: 'Before 1969 when construction of the parking garage began below Red Square and the iconic red bricks were installed, this area’s official name was Central Plaza. But when one The Daily editor referred to the Central Plaza as “Red Square” in 1971, the name stuck.',
      2: 'If you visit the Red Square often enough, you’ll often see seagulls feeding on scraps left on the ground or by people. However, feeding wildlife like seagulls a diet of french fries or bread doesn’t have the same nutritional value of natural foods, which may impact the long-term survival of the birds.',
      3: 'A study from Duke University found that at least 1.4 million seagulls feed at landfills throughout North America, and produce an extra 240 tons of nitrogen and 39 tons of phosphorus into nearby reservoirs and lakes. This results in an increased amount of algae that deplete the water of oxygen and kills fish and other animals as well as lower water quality.',
      4: 'Make sure to not feed wildlife like seagulls and also take any leftovers with you! There are trash cans located across campus for you to use.',

    prompt: 'Find the trash cans located closest to the Suzzallo Library.',

      1: 'Housed within the Communications building is UW’s student run newspaper, The Daily. Founded in 1891, The Daily is currently one of the most awarded college newspapers. They publish online every day of the week, and put out a print paper every Monday.',
      2: 'But what happens to newspapers (or any paper) after you’re done reading them? Most would know to recycle if you can, but is that enough?',
      3: 'According to University College London and Yale researchers, if we continue to recycle paper using the same methods that rely on fossil fuels, emissions could increase by 10% if all waste paper were being recycled by 2050. However, even just moving to using renewable energy while keeping the same recycling and landfill practices would reduce emissions by 96%.',
      4: 'Just because recycling paper alone doesn’t address climate change, doesn’t mean you shouldn’t! Try reusing newspapers at home as well by composting them or even making crafts.',

      1: 'Built in 1949, the Husky Union Building is viewed as the “hub of student life.” The HUB is yet another building named by UW’s student newspaper, and offers various facilities including meeting spaces and the Husky Den Food Court.',
      2: 'According to research from the University of Vermont, between 2007 to 2014, U.S. consumers wasted almost one pound of food per person everyday.',
      3: 'What can we do about the food waste? A UW study by Dr. Sally Brown, a research associate professor in the School of Forest Resources, confirms that composting food waste is much better sustainably than disposing of it in the trash. Food waste shipped to landfills are buried and then decay to produce a significant amount of the greenhouse gas, methane, which is not the case when food waste is composted.',
      4: 'Check to see if your local city or county offers a curbside compost pickup service, and take advantage of it if you can. You can try aerobic (that doesn’t produce methane) composting as well!',

      1: 'Mines Hall was built in 1921 and was renamed to Roberts Hall in 1947 after the dean of the School of Mines. Today, Roberts Hall sits above the basement building, Mueller Hall, and is home to the Department of Materials Science and Engineering.',
      2: 'In an interdisciplinary research study from May 2020 with professors from the departments of Materials Science and Engineering, Aquatic and Fishery Sciences, and Chemistry, they found that presence of microplastics in oysters of the Puget Sound is very low. Out of the ten sites where oysters were collected for analysis, only five of the sites’ oysters contained microplastics.',
      3: 'However, this doesn’t mean that microplastics don’t exist in the waters of the Puget Sound. Instead, these results are the first baseline value for microplastics in oysters from Washington. As global demand for plastic continues to rise, there are an estimated 5 trillion pieces of marine plastic!',
      4: 'So it’s very important to reduce your consumption of single use plastics.',
